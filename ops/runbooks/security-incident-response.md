## Detection and Alerting

### 1. Automated Detection

#### Security Monitoring Alerts
```javascript
// Critical security events that trigger immediate alerts
const criticalSecurityEvents = [
  'multiple_failed_logins',
  'privilege_escalation_attempt',
  'suspicious_api_usage',
  'malware_detection',
  'data_exfiltration_attempt',
  'unauthorized_admin_access',
  'security_tool_disabled',
  'unusual_network_traffic'
];

// Alert configuration
const securityAlerts = {
  channels: ['slack', 'email', 'sms', 'pagerduty'],
  escalation: {
    immediate: ['security-team', 'on-call-engineer'],
    after_15min: ['engineering-manager', 'security-lead'],
    after_30min: ['cto', 'ceo']
  }
};
```

#### Threat Detection Rules
```javascript
// Brute force detection
const bruteForceDetection = {
  threshold: 5, // failed attempts
  timeWindow: 300, // 5 minutes
  action: 'block_ip_and_alert'
};

// Anomaly detection
const anomalyDetection = {
  unusual_login_location: true,
  unusual_login_time: true,
  unusual_api_usage_pattern: true,

## Incident Response Procedures

### 1. Initial Response (First 15 Minutes)

#### Immediate Actions
```bash
# Step 1: Confirm the incident
1. Verify the alert is legitimate
2. Assess the scope and impact
3. Classify the incident severity
4. Activate the incident response team

# Step 2: Contain the threat
1. Isolate affected systems if necessary
2. Block malicious IP addresses
3. Disable compromised accounts
4. Preserve evidence for investigation

# Step 3: Notify stakeholders
1. Alert the incident response team
2. Notify management (for P0/P1 incidents)
3. Document initial findings
4. Start incident tracking
```

#### Containment Procedures
```javascript
// Automated containment actions
const containmentActions = {
  // Block malicious IPs
  blockIP: async (ipAddress, reason) => {
    await securityService.addToBlacklist(ipAddress, {
      reason,
      duration: '24h',
      severity: 'high'
    });
    
    logger.security('IP blocked', { ip: ipAddress, reason });
  },
  
  // Disable compromised accounts
  disableAccount: async (userId, reason) => {
    await authService.disableUser(userId, reason);
    await authService.revokeAllTokens(userId);
    
    logger.security('Account disabled', { userId, reason });
  },
  
  // Isolate affected services
  isolateService: async (serviceName) => {
    await circuitBreaker.open(serviceName);
    await loadBalancer.removeFromPool(serviceName);
    
    logger.security('Service isolated', { service: serviceName });
  }
};
```

### 2. Investigation Phase

#### Evidence Collection
```bash
# System logs collection

2. Security event logs
3. Authentication logs
4. Network traffic logs
5. Database access logs

# System state capture
1. Running processes snapshot
2. Network connections
3. File system changes
4. Memory dumps (if necessary)
5. Configuration snapshots
```

#### Forensic Analysis
```javascript
// Log analysis for security incidents
const analyzeSecurityLogs = async (timeRange) => {
  const analysis = {
    suspiciousIPs: [],
    compromisedAccounts: [],
    maliciousRequests: [],
    dataAccess: [],
    systemChanges: []
  };
  
  // Analyze authentication logs
  const authLogs = await getAuthLogs(timeRange);
  analysis.suspiciousIPs = identifySuspiciousIPs(authLogs);
  analysis.compromisedAccounts = identifyCompromisedAccounts(authLogs);
  
  // Analyze API access logs
  const apiLogs = await getAPILogs(timeRange);
  analysis.maliciousRequests = identifyMaliciousRequests(apiLogs);
  analysis.dataAccess = analyzeDataAccess(apiLogs);
  
  // Analyze system logs
  const systemLogs = await getSystemLogs(timeRange);
  analysis.systemChanges = identifySystemChanges(systemLogs);
  
  return analysis;
};
```

#### Timeline Reconstruction
```javascript
// Create incident timeline
const createIncidentTimeline = (events) => {
  const timeline = events
    .sort((a, b) => new Date(a.timestamp) - new Date(b.timestamp))
    .map(event => ({
      timestamp: event.timestamp,
      source: event.source,
      event: event.description,
      severity: event.severity,
      evidence: event.evidence
    }));
  
  return {
    timeline,
    summary: {
      firstEvent: timeline[0],
      lastEvent: timeline[timeline.length - 1],
      duration: calculateDuration(timeline[0], timeline[timeline.length - 1]),
      eventCount: timeline.length
    }
  };
};
```

    logger.info('Starting system recovery from backup', { backupTimestamp });
    
    // Verify backup integrity
    const backupValid = await verifyBackupIntegrity(backupTimestamp);
    if (!backupValid) {
      throw new Error('Backup integrity check failed');
    }
    
    // Restore data
    await restoreDatabase(backupTimestamp);
    await restoreApplicationFiles(backupTimestamp);
    
    logger.info('System recovery completed');
  },
  
  // Rebuild compromised systems
  rebuildSystem: async (systemId) => {
    logger.info('Rebuilding compromised system', { systemId });
    
    // Deploy clean system image
    await deployCleanImage(systemId);
    
    // Restore data from verified backups
    await restoreVerifiedData(systemId);
    
    // Apply security hardening
    await applySecurityHardening(systemId);
    
    logger.info('System rebuild completed', { systemId });
  }
};
```
